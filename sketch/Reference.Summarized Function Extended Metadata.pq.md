```powerquery
let
  Func = (input as record) => â€¦,
  NewType = type function (
    input as
      [
         Server = text,
         optional Port = number,
         optional CutOff = date
      ]
    ) as any,
  Ascribed = Value.ReplaceType(Func, NewType)
in
  Ascribed
```
becomes

```powerquery
let
  Func = (input as record) => ...,
  NewType = type function (
    input as
      [
        Server = (
          type text meta
          [
             Documentation.SampleValues = { "localhost"}
          ]
        ),
        optional Timeout = (
          type number meta
          [
            Documentation.FieldCaption = "Time Out [in seconds]",
            Documentation.AllowedValues = { 10, 60, 360 }
          ]
        ),
        optional CutOff = date
      ]
    ) as any,
  Ascribed = Value.ReplaceType(Func, NewType)
in
  Ascribed
```
